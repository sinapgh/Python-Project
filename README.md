# Python-Project
this is for the python project. I coded one of the most powerful metaheuristic algorithms in python which is called the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. for the cost function, some mathematical benchmark function was used. the GWO algorithm try to find the global minimum of these benchmark functions.
